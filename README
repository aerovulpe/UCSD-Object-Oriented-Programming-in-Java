Object Oriented Programming in Java: Course Project
=========================================

This repository contains my work for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera, part 1 of 5 in the Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures specialization. 
It uses Unfolding Map and Processing in Eclipse.


The module folders contains the modified starter code and solutions to the required programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

INSTALLATION
------------

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')


MANUAL INSTALLATION

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src


TROUBLE SHOOTING

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
